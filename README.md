# Oftalmologia-lapa

My mother-in-law, an ophthalmologist, needed a website for her clinic. I took the opportunity to give a hand and learn something new in the process.

The design is purposefully minimalist and contrasted, considering the target audience and accessibility.

Code: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

Website link: http://www.oftalmologia-lapa.com.br/. <br>
